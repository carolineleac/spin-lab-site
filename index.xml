Exploring how eye movements and pupil response during learning relate to neurotransmission: A combined neuroimaging and eye tracking study
About the Project Glutamate and GABA are two important neurotransmitters in the brain. Glutamate is the main excitatory neurotransmitter, while GABA is the main inhibitory neurotransmitter. Glutamate and GABA work together to maintain a balance between excitation and inhibition in the brain, which is essential for normal cognitive function.</description></item><item><title>New Paper: A Targeted, Low-Throughput Compound Screen in a Drosophila Model of Neurofibromatosis Type 1 Identifies Simvastatin and BMS-204352 as Potential Therapies for Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)</title><link>https://carolineleac.github.io/spin-lab-site/news/news-3/</link><pubDate>Wed, 26 Apr 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://carolineleac.github.io/spin-lab-site/news/news-3/</guid><description>Check out our latest paper:

We found that for a narrow range of the noise variance, synaptic strength can be optimized. In particular, there is a regime of noise intensity for which synaptic strength presents a triple-stable state. Regulating noise intensity affects the probability that the system chooses one of the stable states, thereby controlling plasticity.</description></item><item><title>New Paper: A mean-field model of glutamate and GABA synaptic dynamics for functional MRS</title><link>https://carolineleac.github.io/spin-lab-site/news/news-5/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Feb 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://carolineleac.github.io/spin-lab-site/news/news-5/</guid><description>In our latest paper we We test the hypothesis that fMRS detects shifts in metabolite concentrations as they move from presynaptic vesicles, where they are largely invisible to MRS, to extracellular and cytosolic pools, where they are visible to MRS using a mean field model which links the neural dynamics of neurotransmitters at the microscopic-level to the macroscopic-level imaging measurements obtained in experimental studies.

We are a research group interested in brain plasticity during neurodevelopment. We use a combination of advanced brain imaging and computational methods to understand how brain plasticity in altered in certain genetic conditions and how that affects learning.
There is a translational focus to our work where we examine the physiological mechanisms of learning and memory identified in animal models in human clinical cohorts, thereby addressing critical translational gap form animal models to humans.</description></item><item><title>Caroline Lea-Carnall</title><link>https://carolineleac.github.io/spin-lab-site/people/caroline/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://carolineleac.github.io/spin-lab-site/people/caroline/</guid><description>Labore duis aute ex id voluptate irure duis esse.

Currently, I work as a postdoctoral research associate for a study titled ‘Neuroimaging in Rasopathies’ (funded by NIHR-BRC) at the faculty of biology, medicine and health, University of Manchester, United Kingdom. In the current research project, we examine the inhibitory/excitatory imbalance associated with GABA/glutamate, functional connectivity and myelin differences underpinning learning and working memory difficulties in children with Rasopathies specifically including Neurofibromatosis type-I and Noonan Syndrome as well as its phenotypic relationship with Autism Spectrum Conditions (ASC).</description></item></channel></rss>
